# Now, hello there. As I stated in my Bio, my name is Muhammad Abdurrahman. I am a college student at Bradford College. I have a deep interest in how computers, and particularly Ariticial Intelligence, work and function. Therefore, I believe the perfect career for me is one in Machine Learning. Currently, I am in a small dilemma of what exactly I want to be, a Data Scientist...or a Machine Learning Engineer. Of course, as shown, my language of choice is Python, which is am currently studying in my spare time (my college course covers all of IT, so there is not enough focus on programming). I am also in the midst of studying Structured Query Language, as I believe that will be useful too. 
# This repository will contain all of my basic code. Frankly, if I am being honest, the reason this repository exists is as of right now I lack the skills necessary to do my own fully fleshed-out projocts (one day, though one day...).
# Thank you for your time. And goodbye.
